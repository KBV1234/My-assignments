      <h2>Articals about Virat kohli</h2>
      <p>Virat Kohli first stood in as captain in a 2013 three-country series in the West Indies when MS Dhoni, the Indian captain at that time, was injured, and continued to lead for the rest of the series. He subsequently led India in an ODI series against Zimbabwe when several senior players were rested. Kohli also captained India in the 2014 Asia Cup in Dhoni’s absence, scoring one hundred, but India failed to reach the final.

      Kohli has always been an aggressive batsman, and he showed this facet in his first Test captaincy, when Dhoni was injured before a match against Australia in Adelaide in 2014. Not content with a century in his captaincy debut in the first innings, Kohli showed he would not play for a draw as many past Indian captains had, scoring 141 in the second innings as India came close to chasing a challenging 364. After Dhoni returned for the second Test, Kohli took over again in the third with Dhoni injured again and scored a century and a fifty as India drew the Test. Dhoni retired after the match, leading to Kohli being announced as the official Test captain from the fourth match onward.

      Captaincy seemed to agree with Kohli in Tests, where he hit his first double century, against the West Indies in 2016, followed by another double against New Zealand the same year, leading India to wins in both series. He hit double hundreds in his next two series against England and Bangladesh as well, becoming the first batsman to hit double centuries in four consecutive series.

      Kohli captained India at the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy, but India lost to Pakistan in the final. Kohli scored two double centuries that year in a Test series against Sri Lanka. He continued to score ODI hundreds. On the 2018 tour to England, he rectified his poor run from the last England tour with a series of good scores, leading India to one win, but the team was defeated in close matches and lost the series 4–1. The same year Kohli became the 13th batsman to score 10,000 runs in ODIs, becoming the fastest to do so, in a full 54 innings fewer than Sachin Tendulkar had, previously the fastest.</p>
